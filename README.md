<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
__Disclaimer: this is an unofficial repo and is not supported by DRACOON__<br>
This package provides a connector to DRACOON API. 
DRACOON is a cloud storage product / service (SaaS) by DRACOON GmbH (http://dracoon.com). 
DRACOON API documentation can be found here (Swagger UI):
https://dracoon.team/api/


### Built With

* [Python 3.9.0](https://www.python.org/)
* [httpx module](https://www.python-httpx.org/)
* [aiohttp module](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/)
* [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)
* [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started, create a virtual environment in Python and install the dracoon package:
```
virtualenv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate 
python3 -m pip install dracoon
```

### Prerequisites

You will need a working Python 3 installation - check your version:
* Python
```
python3 --version
```

### Installation

1. Install the package from PyPi
```
python3 -m pip install dracoon
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Import DRACOON
```
from dracoon import DRACOON
```

This is the main class and contains all other adapters to access DRACOON API endpoints. 
The object contains a client (DRACOONClient) which handles all http connections via httpx (async). 


### Object creation
```
dracoon = DRACOON(base_url, client_id, client_secret)
```

* _client_id_; please register your OAuth app or use dracoon_legacy_scripting (default)
* _client_secret_; please register your OAuth app or use dracoon_legacy_scripting - secret is an empty string (no secret)
* _base_url_: Your DRACOON URL instance (e.g. https://dracoon.team)


### Authentication

#### Password flow

```
connection = await dracoon.connect(OAuth2ConnectionType.password_flow, username, password)
```

The connection result contains the tokens (access and refresh, including validity).

You need pass one of the supported OAuth2 connection types. 
To access the enums, import OAuth2ConnectionType:

```
from dracoon import DRACOON, OAuth2Connectiontype
```

Please note: you can only authenticate if OAuth app is correctly configured. Only local accounts (including Active Directory) can be used via password flow.

#### Authorization code flow
```
connection = await dracoon.connect()
```
If you do not provide a connection type, the default will be auth code.
You will be prompted and asked for an authorization code.

Please note: you can only authenticate if OAuth app is correctly configured. You will need a custom app with authorization code flow enabled and you will need to set your redirect uri to https://your.domain.com/oauth/callback 

#### Test connection
```
connected = dracoon.test_connection()
```
This will provide a true / false result depending on the connection.
An authenticated ping is used to verify the tokens are valid.


#### Log out
```
await dracoon.logout()
```
This will revoke both access and refresh tokens.


### Send requests

1. You can access specific API endpoints by accessing the related adapter, e.g. for users, once you have connected:

```
result = await dracoon.users.get_users()
```

Please note: 
* GET requests are limited to returning 500 items. Therefore all such requests contain an offset parameter (default is 0)
* Providing a filter is optional - see API documentation and examples on usage
* If you do not connect the client, the adapters are not instantiated and 
cannot be accessed!
* All (!) calls are async functions and need to be awaited

Avalailble adapters:

```
dracoon.config - config API including webhooks
dracoon.users - users management
dracoon.groups - groups management
dracoon.user - user account and keypair setup
dracoon.nodes - nodes (up- and download including S3 direct up)
dracoon.shares - shares and file requests
dracoon.uploads - upload API
dracoon.reports - new reporting API
dracoon.eventlog - old eventlog API
```


2. This package contains type hints and includes models for all payloads (updates and create payloads).
To faciliate compliant object creation, there are several helper functions which can be found via make_, e.g.:

```
room = dracoon.nodes.make_room(...)
```

This helps finding the right parameters and building objects that are compliant with the DRACOON models.

## Cryptography

DRACOON cryptography is fully supported by the package. In order to use it, import the relevant functions or en- and decryptors:

```
from dracoon.crypto import create_plain_userkeypair
from dracoon.crypto import create_file_key
```

### Create a new keypair

The account adapter (user) includes a function to set a new keypair:

```
dracoon.user.set_keypair(secret)

```
A new keypair will be generated (4096bit RSA asymmetric).
Prior to setting a new keypair you always need to delete the old one!
Please note: Deleting a keypair can cause data loss.

### Getting your (plain) keypair

In order to work with encrypted rooms you will need to access your keypair:

```
await dracoon.get_keypair()

```
This function of the main API wrapper will prompt for your secret and return a plain keypair for further handling.


### En- and decode on the fly (in memory)

For smaller payload you can directly use the functions returning either
plain or encrypted bytes like this:

```
plain_bytes = decrypt_bytes(enc_data, plain_file_key)
enc_bytes = encrypt_bytes(plain_data, plain_file_key)

```

### Chunking

For larger files it is recommended to encrypt (and upload) in chunks.
An example of encryptor usage:

```
dracoon_cipher = FileEncryptionCipher(plain_file_key=plain_file_key)
enc_chunk = dracoon_cipher.encode_bytes(chunk)
last_data, plain_file_key = dracoon_cipher.finalize()

```
You can instantiate an encryptor / decryptor by passing a plain file key.
When finalizing, you need to add the last data to the last chunk.
The result of the completed encryption is an updated plain_file_key with a specific tag.

Hint: You do not need to implement the upload process and can directly use full methods in the uploads adapter (see next chapter).

## Uploads

The uploads adapter includes full methods to upload data to DRACOON and includes chunking and encryption support.

Here is an example of uploading a file to an encrypted room with only a few lines of code:

```
upload_channel = CreateUploadChannel(parentId=9999, name=file_path.split('/')[-1])

res = await dracoon.nodes.create_upload_channel(upload_channel=upload_channel)
channel_res = res.json()

res = await dracoon.uploads.upload_encrypted(file_path=file_path, target_id=9999, upload_channel=channel_res, plain_keypair=plain_keypair)
    
```

The default chunk size is 5 MB but can be passed as an option (chunksize, in bytes).

The main API wrapper will include more comfortable upload APIs in the future (1 line approach).

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* Add download functionality (chunked, analogue to upload)
* Add S3 direct upload
* Add branding API 
* Improve main wrapper functions (1 line up- and download)
